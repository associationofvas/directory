__Professional Bio:__ I currently manage Operations for my company and am the Sr., Administrative Recruiter. After a 27-year career in solely administrative roles, (most of which was spent assisting C-Suite executives in various industries, both on a national level and with their global counterparts in corporate settings), I started my virtual company, Tandem Resource Solutions (TRS). I have worked in and managed offices from the small 6-person office to the larger 100-300 person office. My industry background is diverse (non-profit, home building, engineering, software, medical - to name a few) and experience invaluable. It has enabled me to progress my career into that of a small business owner, mentor, advocate, and recruiter of all admins.

 My goal is to seamlessly match indispensable assistants with clients. I also aspire to increase recognition of administrative professionals through my volunteer work in the community and networking with my administrative counterparts. Working as an Executive Admin (EA) for my entire career up until now, I had been relied upon and considered the right arm of my executives (often referred to as ""their person"") and always made this my mission to learn all there is to know about the industry & company culture, in order to differentiate me from your average every day EA. At TRS, matching and/or complimenting personalities is a must for me! It is invariably my goal and intent to make that happen; develop those valuable partnerships with every single placement ~ All this via the recruitment & placement of permanent admins in traditional corporate office settings, or by pairing a Virtual Assistant from my team with a remote client.
